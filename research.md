      <b> Robot manipulation planning under uncertainty using hybrid dynamics </b>
      	<p> The difficulty of many robot manipulation tasks stems from stochasticity and partial observability coupled with highly nonlinear dynamics. However, much of the nonlinearity in manipulation tasks can be explained by sudden changes in contact or articulated state. This fact allows the dynamics to be naturally factored into a discrete set of simpler models combined together as a hybrid dynamics model. To leverage these hybrid dynamics for efficient planning under uncertainty, we introduce a novel POMDP planner that computes and stabilizes around trajectories in a hybrid belief space. We evaluate the proposed planner in both a simulated navigation domain, as well as an assembly task with a real robotic manipulator.
